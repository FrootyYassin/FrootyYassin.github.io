          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Yassin Sedougui, a 18-year-old entrepreneur and software developer. I take great pride in developing websites and applications that are not only visually appealing but also functionally robust.
          </p>
          <p>
            In creating this website, I utilized various technologies to ensure an optimal user experience. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Bootstrap framework providing a responsive design and enhanced styling. By leveraging Bootstrap's pre-built components and CSS classes, I achieved a modern and professional look.
          </p>
          <p>
            The navigation bar at the top of the page is a dynamic feature that collapses on smaller screens to enhance usability. It allows visitors to navigate easily through different sections of the website, such as the Home, About, Projects, and Contact pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the Home page, I wanted to make a strong first impression. The content is centered, featuring a prominent heading that welcomes visitors to my portfolio. Beneath the heading, I've included a brief introduction highlighting my background as an entrepreneur and software developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and make a positive impact on society. As such, I have dedicated myself to learning various programming languages and frameworks. Through self-study and online resources, I have gained proficiency in languages such as Python, JavaScript, CSS, Lua, and HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for entrepreneurship has also driven me to identify opportunities in the market and turn ideas into successful business ventures. I have launched several projects that have gained recognition and traction within their respective industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my journey as a software developer and entrepreneur, I have come to appreciate the value of collaboration and teamwork. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can contribute my technical expertise and creative thinking to achieve meaningful results.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you explore my portfolio, I hope you'll gain insights into my skills and projects. I invite you to view my Projects page, where you'll find examples of my work and the innovative solutions I have created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
